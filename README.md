# UNDERTAROT - An Undertale Tarot Mod for Balatro
---
This mod replaces the default tarots sprites with the [UNDERTALE Tarot Prints set from Fangamer](https://www.fangamer.com/products/undertale-tarot-cards). The art is [illustrated by Dogbomber](https://www.tumblr.com/dogbomber/tagged/undertale%20tarot). UNDERTALE sprites are from Toby Fox and Temmie Chang. The modded sprites and code are edited by strawberryowl96.

Requires [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk).

## Features:
- New textures for each Tarot consumable. Each character is matched with the number that appeared at the top of their Tarot card. 
- Since each tarot card was renamed to that character, the Tarot consumable is renamed to that assigned character as well. 
- New texture for the Charm Tag. It has also been renamed to Mercy Tag.
- New textures for the Arcana packs.
- Since there are many cards that share the same arcana number, this mod gives you an option to switch between them. Here are the tarots with alternate art: Lovers (Royal Guards to Dogamy & Dogaressa), Star (Mettaton to his final No Mercy route form), Sun (Monster Kid to Grillby), â‹…World (Mt. Ebott to Stronger Monsters).
- Added former royal scientist W.D. Gaster as an alternative art for Hermit. Gaster is not in the official tarot set, nor is his actual design confirmed. I just added it for fun and because his art is already available online since he is in the original pitch for the tarot set.
- Enables the option to swap Undyne and Greater Dog from their respective arcana/tarot. This means that Undyne becomes Justice and Greater Dog becomes Strength. This is largely inspired by [saveloadreset's analysis](https://saveloadreset.tumblr.com/post/151924918518/ut-tarot-major-arcana) on what their respective arcana represent for them.
- Enables the option to rename The Protagonist and The Fallen Child to their true names.
- Gives Sans some pink slippers, which replaces his blue ones. This is for all the pink slipper headcanon fans out there. 
- Added localization for all current available languages. (I'm aware it is not perfect, so please like me know if there are any glaring grammar and spelling issues.)
- The tarot sprites used are cropped and edited from the original art to get a better close-up look at the tarot art. As a consolation, this mod gives you an option to change the sprites to a less edited, smaller version with its original ratio if desired. This has to be done manually in your Mods folder. 

## Installation: 
### Part 1: For those who don't have Malverk installed: 
- Install [Lovely](https://github.com/ethangreen-dev/lovely-injector) & [Steammodded](https://github.com/Steamopollys/steamodded). There's a [nice tutorial video about this process](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uDfxnwHO134) if you're a bit lost.
- Download the [Malverk](https://github.com/Eremel/Malverk) file from the Releases section on the right-hand column. Unzip the file and put the extracted folder in the Mods folder where you installed Lovely & Steammodded.
- Go to Part 2.

### Part 2: For those who already have Malverk installed: 
- Download the latest version of the file from the Releases section.
- Unzip file and put the extracted folder in the "Mods" folder.
- Open Balatro and make sure the mod is enabled on the MOD list in the main menu. 
- To add the mod, open Options > Textures.
- Click on the card and press Apply. Move card to the right side next to "Highest". 
- To go to this mod's Settings, click on the card again and click on the gear at the right of the card.

### Part 3: For those who want to switch sprite set options:
- Be sure to do this while the game is closed.
- Unzip file named "UNDERTAROT Sprites with..." from the original zip file. You now have the folders "1x" and "2x".
- Go to the original "1x" and "2x" and paste it with the newly extracted "1x" and "2x" folders.
- Open Balatro.
- To return the original sprites, unzip the "UNDERTAROT Sprites with Edited Ratio" file and repeat the process.
